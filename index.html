    <p>Now . . .</p>
    <p>Newton, Einstein, and Pascal are playing hide and seek</p>
    <p>It's Einstein's turn to seek. He starts counting, and Pascal runs to hide in a tree,</p>
    <p>but Newton just crouches down to draw a square around him 1 meter across.</p>
    <p>When Einstein finishes counting, he opens his eyes to see Newton standing in front of him and exclaims, "Ha! Found you!"</p>
    <p>But Newton replies, "No, you found Pascal!"</p>
